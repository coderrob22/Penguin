# Penguin Page

## What is it?
This is a page designed to show a beautiful picture of a penguin on a sunny day.

## How was it built?
It was built using css and html. 

## What did you learn?
This project taught me about Keyframes animation and taught me about using variables too. Though I have used linear gradients in the past, this also gave me more opportunity to use gradients.
